# Sequence for Unity!

## Using the unitypackage

1. Import Vuplex.
2. Import SequenceSharp.unitypackage.

If you want to avoid buying Vuplex WebGL, since it's not technically used, then to do a WebGL build, _first move the Vuplex folder out of your project_, then move it back in after your build is done.

## Creating the UnityPackage

Choose everything in the SequenceSharp and SequenceIndexer folders, the StreamingAssets/sequence folder, and the file Vuplex/VuplexAssemblyReference
