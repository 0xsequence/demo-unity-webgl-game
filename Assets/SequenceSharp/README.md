# Sequence for Unity!

## Using the UnityPackage

1. Import Vuplex for each platform you are building for. https://vuplex.com
   If you want to avoid buying Vuplex WebGL, since it's not technically used, then every time you do a WebGL build, _first move the Vuplex folder out of your project_, then move it back in after your build is done.
2. Import SequenceSharp.unitypackage.

## Creating the UnityPackage ( for SequenceSharp development )

Choose everything in the SequenceSharp, SequenceIndexer, and StreamingAssets/sequence folders.
